    <h3>ABOUT PRABHAS</h3>
    <p align="justify">
        Prabhas made his acting debut with the 2002 drama Eeswar, and later attained his breakthrough with the action romance Varsham (2004). He went on to act in other commercially successful films such as Chatrapathi (2005), Bujjigadu (2008), Billa (2009), Darling (2010), Mr. Perfect (2011), and Mirchi (2013), winning the Nandi Award for Best Actor for his performance in the lattermost.[9][10] In 2015, he went on to play a dual role in the epic action film Baahubali: The Beginning which received national and international acclaim, and became a record-breaking box office success. He reprised his role in the sequel, Baahubali 2: The Conclusion (2017) which rewrote several box office records and emerged as the highest-grossing Indian film at that point, establishing Prabhas as the first pan-Indian star.[11][12] Commercial success has since varied, with action thrillers Saaho (2019) and Salaar: Part 1 â€“ Ceasefire (2023) emerging as box-office hits.
